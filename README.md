# EUCcheduler  

**EUCcheduler** is our final project assigned by our professor, designed as a collaborative effort among our team. This project consists of three integrated systems:  
- **Two mobile applications** (one for students and one for teachers)  
- **One admin website**  

### System Overview  

#### 1. **Student Application**  
The primary purpose of the student app is to provide a centralized platform where students can:  
- View their class schedules conveniently  
- Access announcements linked to each schedule  

#### 2. **Teacher Application**  
The teacher app is designed to empower teachers by enabling them to:  
- Create and manage class schedules  
- Post announcements for their assigned classes  

#### 3. **Admin Dashboard**  
The admin website plays a vital role in managing the system:  
- Grant access exclusively to bonafide students and teachers  
- Create and modify schedules for both students and teachers  

### Purpose  
EUCcheduler helps the process of managing and viewing class schedules and announcements, providing a seamless experience for students, teachers, and administrators alike. This project highlights the power of collaboration and teamwork in delivering practical solutions for academic needs.
